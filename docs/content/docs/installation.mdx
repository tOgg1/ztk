# Installation

## Prerequisites

- **Git** installed and configured
- **Zig** compiler (0.13.0 or later) for building from source
- A **GitHub account** with a personal access token

## Building from Source

ztk is written in Zig. Clone the repository and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tOgg1/ztk.git
cd ztk
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

The binary will be available at `zig-out/bin/ztk`.

## Add to PATH

Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:

```bash
# Option 1: User-local bin
cp zig-out/bin/ztk ~/.local/bin/

# Option 2: System-wide
sudo cp zig-out/bin/ztk /usr/local/bin/
```

## GitHub Authentication

ztk needs to authenticate with GitHub to create and update PRs. You have two options:

### Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)

If you have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated, ztk will automatically use it:

```bash
gh auth login
```

### Option 2: Personal Access Token

Create a GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select the `repo` scope
4. Copy the token

Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

Add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to persist it.

## Verify Installation

```bash
ztk help
```

You should see:
