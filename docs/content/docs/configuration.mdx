# Configuration

ztk uses a `.ztk.json` file in your repository root for configuration.

## Config File

Running `ztk init` creates a config file like:

```json
{
  "owner": "your-username",
  "repo": "your-repo",
  "main_branch": "main",
  "remote": "origin"
}
```

## Options

### owner

**Required.** The GitHub username or organization that owns the repository.

```json
{
  "owner": "mycompany"
}
```

### repo

**Required.** The GitHub repository name.

```json
{
  "repo": "my-project"
}
```

### main_branch

**Required.** The name of your main/trunk branch. ztk creates PRs targeting this branch.

```json
{
  "main_branch": "main"
}
```

Common values: `main`, `master`, `develop`

### remote

**Optional.** The Git remote name. Defaults to `origin`.

```json
{
  "remote": "origin"
}
```

## Environment Variables

### GITHUB_TOKEN

GitHub personal access token for API authentication. Required if you don't have `gh` CLI installed.

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The token needs `repo` scope for private repositories.

### Using gh CLI

If you have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated, ztk will use it automatically. No token needed.

```bash
gh auth login
```

## Example Configurations

### Standard Setup

```json
{
  "owner": "acme",
  "repo": "widgets",
  "main_branch": "main",
  "remote": "origin"
}
```

### Develop Branch Workflow

```json
{
  "owner": "acme", 
  "repo": "widgets",
  "main_branch": "develop",
  "remote": "origin"
}
```

### Fork Workflow

When working on a fork, you might have:
- `origin` → your fork
- `upstream` → the original repo

For PRs to your own fork:

```json
{
  "owner": "your-username",
  "repo": "forked-repo",
  "main_branch": "main",
  "remote": "origin"
}
```

## Committing Config

We recommend committing `.ztk.json` to your repository so all team members can use ztk with the same configuration.

```bash
git add .ztk.json
git commit -m "Add ztk configuration"
```
