# ztk status

Display the status of your current commit stack and associated PRs.

## Usage

ztk status
ztk s       # alias

```

## Description

The `status` command shows a visual representation of your commit stack, including:

- All commits ahead of main branch
- Associated PR numbers and links
- CI check status (passing, failing, pending)
- Review status (approved, changes requested, awaiting review)
- Merge conflicts detection
- WIP commit indicators

## Output Example

```
