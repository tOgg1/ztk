# ztk open

Open pull requests from your stack in your default browser.

## Usage

```bash
ztk open
ztk o       # alias
```

## Description

The `open` command opens PR pages on GitHub in your default browser. 

- If there's **one PR** in your stack, it opens immediately
- If there are **multiple PRs**, you get an interactive selection

## Single PR

When your stack has one PR:

```bash
$ ztk open
  Opening PR #47: Add authentication middleware
```

Your browser opens to `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/47`.

## Multiple PRs

When you have multiple PRs, ztk shows a selection menu:

```
  Select a PR to open:

    [1] #47 Add authentication middleware
    [2] #46 Add database layer
    [3] #45 Add core utilities

  Enter number (1-3): 
```

Enter a number to open that PR, or press Enter/q to cancel.
