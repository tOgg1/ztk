# Quick Start

This guide walks you through creating your first stacked PR workflow with ztk.

## 1. Initialize a Repository

Navigate to your Git repository and initialize ztk:

```bash
cd your-repo
ztk init
```

ztk automatically detects your GitHub remote and creates a `.ztk.json` config file:

```json
{
  "owner": "your-github-username",
  "repo": "your-repo-name",
  "main_branch": "main",
  "remote": "origin"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Commit `.ztk.json` to your repository so teammates can use ztk too.
</Callout>

## 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

## 3. Make Focused Commits

Create small, focused commits. **Each commit will become its own PR:**

```bash
# First logical change
echo "core utilities" > utils.go
git add . && git commit -m "Add core utilities"

# Second change (builds on first)
echo "database layer" > db.go
git add . && git commit -m "Add database layer"

# Third change (builds on second)
echo "api endpoints" > api.go
git add . && git commit -m "Add API endpoints"
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Write commit messages as you would PR titles — they become the PR titles automatically.
</Callout>

## 4. Check Your Stack

```bash
ztk status
```

Output:
```
  Stack: feature/my-feature  (3 commits ahead of main)

  ◉  Add API endpoints              ← you are here
  │  No PR
  │
  ◯  Add database layer
  │  No PR
  │
  ◯  Add core utilities
  │  No PR
  │
  ◯  main

  Summary: 3 commits
```

## 5. Push to GitHub

```bash
ztk update
```

ztk will:
1. Add tracking IDs to commits (first run only)
2. Create a branch for each commit
3. Push branches to GitHub
4. Create PRs with proper stacking

```
  Adding ztk-id markers to commits...
    └─ Added ztk-id to: Add core utilities
    └─ Added ztk-id to: Add database layer
    └─ Added ztk-id to: Add API endpoints
  ✓ ztk-ids added

  Syncing stack to GitHub...

  ◯ Add core utilities
    └─ Pushing... done
    └─ Creating PR... done → #45

  ◯ Add database layer
    └─ Pushing... done
    └─ Creating PR... done → #46

  ◉ Add API endpoints
    └─ Pushing... done
    └─ Creating PR... done → #47

  ✓ Stack synced: 3 PRs created
```

## 6. Check Status with PR Info

Run `ztk status` again to see PR status:

```
  Stack: feature/my-feature  (3 commits ahead of main)

  ◉  Add API endpoints              ← you are here
  │  #47 · ✓ Checks · ⏳ Awaiting review
  │
  ◯  Add database layer
  │  #46 · ✓ Checks · ⏳ Awaiting review
  │
  ◯  Add core utilities
  │  #45 · ✓ Checks · ✓ Approved · Ready to merge
  │
  ◯  main

  Summary: 3 commits · 3 PRs · 1 ready to merge
```

## What's Next?

- **Make changes?** Use `ztk modify` to amend any commit in the stack
- **Auto-fix changes?** Use `ztk absorb` to automatically route staged changes to the right commits
- **Sync with main?** Use `ztk sync` to rebase and clean up merged branches
- **Update PRs?** Just run `ztk update` again after making changes
