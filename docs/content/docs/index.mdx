# ztk

**ztk** is a CLI tool for managing stacked pull requests with a beautiful, Graphite-inspired terminal interface. Written in Zig for speed and simplicity.

## Why Stacked PRs?

Traditional Git workflows often result in large, monolithic PRs that are:
- Difficult to review thoroughly
- Slow to get through code review
- Risky to merge due to their size

Stacked PRs break changes into smaller, focused commits where **each commit becomes its own PR**. This makes code review faster, safer, and more effective.

## Why ztk?

```
  Stack: feature/auth  (3 commits ahead of main)

  ◉  Add authentication middleware           ← you are here
  │  #47 · ✓ Checks · ✓ Approved · Ready to merge
  │
  ◯  Add user database schema
  │  #46 · ✓ Checks · ⏳ Awaiting review
  │
  ◯  Add core utilities
  │  #45 · ✓ Checks · ✓ Approved · Ready to merge
  │
  ◯  main

  Summary: 3 commits · 3 PRs · 2 ready to merge
```

ztk gives you:

- **Visual stack representation** — See your entire PR stack at a glance with tree visualization
- **One command sync** — Push all changes and create/update PRs with `ztk update`
- **Human-first design** — Clear status indicators with colors and Unicode icons
- **Smart workflows** — Commands like `modify` and `absorb` make editing commits in the middle of your stack easy
- **Stateless operation** — No local database; reads Git + GitHub state each run

## Quick Example

```bash
# Create a feature branch with multiple commits
git checkout -b feature/auth-system
echo "schema" > db.sql && git add . && git commit -m "Add user database schema"
echo "middleware" > auth.go && git add . && git commit -m "Add authentication middleware"

# Initialize ztk and sync to GitHub
ztk init
ztk update
```

This creates two stacked PRs:
- **PR #1:** "Add user database schema" (base: main)
- **PR #2:** "Add authentication middleware" (base: PR #1)
